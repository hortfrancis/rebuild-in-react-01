# Rebuild in React #01

This project is the result of an experiment to take a page from an existing frontend (created with OutSystems) and see if it is possible to rebuild the user interface in React using generative AI (GPT-4o). 

Of particular interest here are the Bash script files `update_structure.sh`, `populate_components.sh`, and `populate.css`, which determine the project's file strucure and add generated code to various files across the project. 

This was reasonably success and I would say promising.
